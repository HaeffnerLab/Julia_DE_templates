# Julia_DE_templates
This repository is a template showing how to use Julia to integrate differential equations.

In template.jl, we show how to solve a simple ODE problem using the DifferentialEquations.jl package.
In SH_template.jl, we combine it with SphericalHarmonicExpansions.jl for typical ion/electron trap case.
